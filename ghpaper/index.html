            <h2>The Impact of Technological Dependence</h2>
            <p>By many articles written, published, and discoverable via Google and other search engines, searches for this specific topic is always found in a very negative tone, almost as if technology itself is a cancer we enable to metastasize. Just three links down from the search bar and an <a href="https://zeenews.india.com/news/health/tips/harmful-effects-of-technological-dependence-on-health-and-lifestyle_1814398.html>article</a> listing off many harmful side effects is displayed ranging from excessive smartphone use, to development in children issues, to poor sleeping habits.</p>
            <p>Is this very much an issue where we must become cautious as to stay away from technological uses as critically as possible?</p>

            <h3>Anxiety</h3>
            <p>Our dependence on technology has removed our need to handle life's small issues with any level of uncertainty. This seems like a great benefit at first but now when faced with lifes big things like finding a career or love, we no longer feel prepared to handle the heavier emotion of these decisions.</p>
            <blockquote>When we’re accustomed to taking our time to think of exactly what we want to say, we find it harder to do it face-to-face and on the fly. And of course, when there’s less real-time experience to draw on, we stay shaky and uncertain, which in turn makes us anxious. (Hendriksen)</blockquote>
            <p>Nobody can blame you for wanting to avoid the crowd but technology has allowed us to avoid contact with others as a default experience. As we interact with others with less frequency, we increasingly assume worst case scenarios and have reduced confidence in our own ability to interface with others.</p>
            <p>Social media has become a platform to highlight and magnify everything we have been told to keep to ourselves. Politcs, sexuality, and religion are polarizing topics and now are in the open to be scrutinized not only by our close friends and family but also the world. Technology has solved many of lifes problems but now it is creating new ones; or at least bringing existing ones out into the open. The algorithms put in place by the people building these platforms further divide us as it helps put us in a box with like minded folks. One could argue at first that this is great to find a social circle of people that feel the same as you do but when you lose the other perspective, anxiety builds quickly once you are reintroduced to the other side.</p>

            <h3>Pushback</h3>
            <img src="images/distractions.jpg" alt="Technology Pushback">
            <p>As society becomes more aware of the consequences of spending hours of time each day on our phones, tablets, and computers there is a growing movement to pushback against the pull of technology. The writer Blake Snow has called this movement “reformed luddism”: a society that views tech with a sceptical eye, noting the benefits while recognising that it causes problems, too. (Bartlett)</p>
            
            <p>This pushback can take many forms:</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Creating blocks of time to turn off phones and computers</li>
                <li>Taking entire weekends to be free of technology</li>
                <li>Forbidding phones at the dinner table</li>
            
            </ul>
